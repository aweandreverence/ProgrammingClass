# Required Course Materials

- **Computer**: In order to fully participate in the class, it is recommended to have a not-too-old computer running either MacOS or Windows. There may be some limitations in course instructional materials or ability to perform the assignments with as much ease if using Windows, and unfortunately, I am not able to provide as much support for Windows-based development.
- **Parental involvement**: For maximum impact, it would be best if parents can be involved in their student's participation of this class. It is suggested that parents ask their students to share with them what they are learning, and what they are doing for homework.
- **Online safety**: While not covered by the scope of this class, doing the homework and accessing supplemental learning materials will require students to access the internet. The internet is a big place, connecting virtually all of the computers in the world (and by proxy, all of the people using those computers). Having such unprecedented access is a major advantage, but it does come with potential dangers if one is not careful. Please see https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/net-safety.html for tips on staying safe online.
- **Communication**: To officially participate in this class, it's required to join the Slack community. Upon admittance to the class, both students and parents will receive an invitation link to join the Slack comunity. Active participation, including asking questions, is highly encouraged.
