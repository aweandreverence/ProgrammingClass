# Computer Science for Beginners

## Introduction

Hi! My name is [Jonathan Tsai](https://github.com/jontsai) and I created this course. I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/cs/) in [2006](https://cal.berkeley.edu/jontsai). During my undergraduate studies, I studied under and worked with [Dr. Dan Garcia](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ddgarcia/), one of the renowned instructors of computer science in the nation, and my teaching style and methodology is largely inspired by him.

This is an introductory programming class meant to be taught to kids aged 11 or older. In the summer of 2024, I am currently teaching my son and a couple of his friends computer programming.
