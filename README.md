# Computer Science for Beginners

## Introduction

Hi! My name is [Jonathan Tsai](https://github.com/jontsai) and I created this course. I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/cs/) in [2006](https://cal.berkeley.edu/jontsai). During my undergraduate studies, I studied under and worked with [Dr. Dan Garcia](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ddgarcia/), one of the renowned instructors of computer science in the nation, and my teaching style and methodology is largely inspired by him.

Professionally, I have been working in Silicon Valley for over 2 decades as a software engineer at various technology companies, both large enterprises as well as startups.

This is an introductory programming class meant to be taught to kids aged 11 or older. In the summer of 2024, I am currently teaching my son and a couple of his friends computer programming.

This course aims to find a balance among teaching fundamental theories and concepts (30%), computer programming and languages (25%), software engineering (25%), and software engineering and programming techniques (25%) -- meaning, you will get A LOT more CS theory (ideally) than a traditional (college-level) programming class, but you will not get as much theory as a traditional (college-level) CS class.

If you ask most kids, they will say that they want to learn computer programming so that they can make their own video games.

So, as a final project, we will aim to build AND publish and fully functional video game!

## Required Materials

- **Computer**: In order to fully participate in the class, it is recommended to have a not-too-old computer running either MacOS or Windows. There may be some limitations in course instructional materials or ability to perform the assignments with as much ease if using Windows, and unfortunately, I am not able to provide as much support for Windows-based development.
- **Parental involvement**: For maximum impact, it would be best if parents can be involved in their student's participation of this class. It is suggested that parents ask their students to share with them what they are learning, and what they are doing for homework.
- **Online safety**: While not covered by the scope of this class, doing the homework and accessing supplemental learning materials will require students to access the internet. The internet is a big place, connecting virtually all of the computers in the world (and by proxy, all of the people using those computers). Having such unprecedented access is a major advantage, but it does come with potential dangers if one is not careful. Please see https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/net-safety.html for tips on staying safe online.
- **Communication**: To officially participate in this class, it's required to join the Slack community. Upon admittance to the class, both students and parents will receive an invitation link to join the Slack comunity. Active participation, including asking questions, is highly encouraged.

## Lessons

Each lesson is accompanied with homework assignments and supplemental learning materials. There's a lot of existing good material online, so it doesn't always make sense for me to recreate them. It's recommended for students to go at their own pace, and to optimize for learning and absorption of the material while simultaneously rememember to maximize enjoyment and having fun.
