## Lesson 4: Python Lab Part 2

Lesson Date: 2024-07-21

### Topics

- Lab-only, no lecture.
   - Students should bring their laptops and expect to write code (or if they haven't yet, get help with setting up their IDEs to write some code), or pair up with other students and write code together.
- Work through Exercism exercises together as a class.
   - [Currency Exchange in Python](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/currency-exchange/solutions/jontsai)
   - [Meltdown Mitigation in Python](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/meltdown-mitigation/solutions/jontsai)
      - Using `lambda` to define several simple check functions, which can be evaluated within a for loop, can be another way to efficiently check against a list of cascading `if`-`elif`-`else` conditions.
      - This is the essence of a "rules engine", or list of rules.
