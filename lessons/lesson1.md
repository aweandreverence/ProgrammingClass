2. **History of Computer Science**
   - Computer science has roots that are hundreds or even thousands of years old. [Khan Academy: History of Computing](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science)
   - Definition of a computer: something that computes. [Simple Wikipedia: Computer](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer)
   - Early computers include the abacus. [Wikipedia: Abacus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus)

3. **Algorithms**
   - Definition: A series of steps or instructions to accomplish a task. [Simple Wikipedia: Algorithm](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm)
   - Examples of real-life algorithms:
     - Maps with turn-by-turn driving directions.
     - Recipes for baking cookies.
        - What would happen if you followed the instructions, but out of order?

4. **Modern Computers**
   - Emerged in the 1960s-1970s. [Khan Academy: Modern Computers](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science)
   - Key invention: transistor. [Wikipedia: Transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor)
   - Transistor: An element with three wires that can allow high or low voltage to pass a signal through.

5. **Early Communication**
   - Methods: smoke signals, Morse code. [Simple Wikipedia: Smoke Signal](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_signal), [Simple Wikipedia: Morse Code](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code)

6. **Counting and Number Systems**
   - Arabic numbers, decimal system (base 10). [Simple Wikipedia: Decimal](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal)
   - Humans have 10 fingers and toes, hence base 10.
   - Digits explained.
     - For example, the number 1492 can be broken down as follows:
       - \(1 \times 10^3 = 1000\)
       - \(4 \times 10^2 = 400\)
       - \(9 \times 10^1 = 90\)
       - \(2 \times 10^0 = 2\)
       - Adding these together, \(1000 + 400 + 90 + 2 = 1492\).

7. **Binary System**
   - Binary digits (bits): Can be 0 or 1. [Simple Wikipedia: Binary](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number)
   - With one hand, you can count up to 31 (32 values including 0).
   - Binary example:
     - The binary number `1101` can be broken down as follows:
       - \(1 \times 2^3 = 8\)
       - \(1 \times 2^2 = 4\)
       - \(0 \times 2^1 = 0\)
       - \(1 \times 2^0 = 1\)
       - Adding these together, \(8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13\).

     - \(2^{12} = 4096\)
     - \(2^{13} = 8192\)
     - \(2^{14} = 16384\)
     - \(2^{15} = 32768\)
     - \(2^{16} = 65536\)
     - \(2^{17} = 131072\)
     - \(2^{18} = 262144\)
     - \(2^{19} = 524288\)
     - \(2^{20} = 1048576\)
     - \(2^{21} = 2097152\)
     - \(2^{22} = 4194304\)
     - \(2^{23} = 8388608\)
     - \(2^{24} = 16777216\)
     - \(2^{25} = 33554432\)
     - \(2^{26} = 67108864\)
     - \(2^{27} = 134217728\)
     - \(2^{28} = 268435456\)
