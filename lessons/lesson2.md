## Lesson 2: Functions

Lesson Date: 2024-06-30

### Topics

- Domain and Range
   - Domain: The set of all possible inputs
   - Range: The set of all possible outputs
- Function **Signature**
   - Name
   - Parameter list
- Parameters vs Arguments
   - Technically, they refer to the same thing, but have slight nuanced differences
   - Similar to: **Emigrate (from)** vs **Immigrate (to)**
   - Functions **receive** parameters
   - Functions are **called (or invoked)** with arguments
- [Arity of Functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity)
   - Nullary / Niladic (receives 0 arguments)
   - Unary / Monadic (receives 1 argument)
   - Binary / Dyadic (receives 2 arguments)
   - Ternary / Triadic (receives 3 arguments)
   - Quaternary / Tetradic (4)
   - Quinary / Pentadic (5)
   - Senary / Hexadic (6)
   - Septenary / Hebdomadic (7)
   - Octonary / Ogdoadic (8)
   - Nonary / Enneadic (9)
   - Denary / Decenary
   - n-ary
   - Variadic (varying arguments)
- [Composition of functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition)
   - Functions that call other functions
   - [Single-responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)
      - One function should do one thing
- Abstraction & Encapsulation
   - Things we use in our daily lives without understanding how they work "under the hood"
      - Cars
      - Airplanes
- Helper Functions
   - Break down more complex steps into logical sections
   - Think about making a PB&J sandwich... now, making a pizza. Making a pizza requires multiple phases.
   - Helpers vs Utilities
      - Not useful standalone (helper functions) vs useful standalone (utility functions)
- Recursion
   - It is its own helper function
   - Base case(s)
   - Recursive case(s)
   - Subproblems
- Recursion Examples
   - Video call infinite mirroring

### Homework

Please sign up for the Python + Javascript track on Exercism:
- Python: https://exercism.org/tracks/python
- JavaScript: https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript

**Notes**

- Since students should already have GitHub accounts, please sign up for Exercism using GitHub.
- Exercism is nice, used by A LOT of people, and has both an online as well as an offline (requires installing software on local computer) option.
- Get through as many exercises as you can (at the minimum, try to do 1)
- FWIW (for what it's worth), it took me 5 minutes to sign up and complete the first exercise in Python -- most of the time was spent reading the website instructions and understanding its layout -- and 20 seconds to complete the first exercise in JavaScript
- Just a friendly reminder that it's not a race or a competition.

**General reminders**

- If you are stuck on anything for 15-30 minutes without a way forward, please post any question(s) in the Slack channel to ask for help!
