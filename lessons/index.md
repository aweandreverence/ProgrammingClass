# Lessons

Each lesson is accompanied with homework assignments and supplemental learning materials. There's a lot of existing good material online, so it doesn't always make sense for me to recreate them. It's recommended for students to go at their own pace, and to optimize for learning and absorption of the material while simultaneously rememember to maximize enjoyment and having fun.
